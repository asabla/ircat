# PLAN — ircat v1.1.0

The v1.0.0 release shipped a feature-complete IRC server: full
client surface (RFC 1459/2812), persistent operators and channels,
htmx dashboard, admin API, sandboxed Lua bots, jsonl + webhook
event sinks, two-node federation with TLS, and a hardened
production compose stack. See [`PLAN-v1.0.md`](PLAN-v1.0.md) for
the historical record of M0 → M8.

v1.1.0 picks up the items that were explicitly deferred from v1.0
plus the polish work that the v1.0 audit surfaced. The cuts are
deliberately small — v1.1 is a hardening + polish release, not a
new-feature release. New surfaces (IRCv3 caps beyond CAP END,
SERVICE pseudo-server, full SQUIT recovery) live in v1.2+.

## Theme

> "Make the v1.0 surface boring to operate at scale, and close the
> obvious follow-ups from the v1.0 federation MVP."

## Milestones

### M9 — Federation hardening

**Goal:** the federation transport stops being "MVP" and starts
being production.

Shipped:
- Channel mode burst on link-up (TOPIC + canonical mode word +
  per-member +o/+v) and runtime MODE re-application on the
  receiver via a new `applyRemoteChannelMode` helper that
  forwards each toggle to the existing `state.Channel` setters.
- SQUIT recovery on link drop and remote SQUIT propagation:
  `Server.HandleSquit` walks the world, removes every user
  homed on the dropped peer, fans synthetic QUITs to local
  channel members, and forwards SQUIT to remaining links.
- Subscription-aware channel routing with the v1.0 fanout
  available behind `federation.broadcast_mode`. Subscriptions
  are tracked explicitly via `Server.SubscribePeerToChannel`,
  populated by `sendBurst` (when we tell a peer about a
  channel) and by `handleRemoteJoin` (when a peer tells us
  about one). JOIN remains fanned out so it can establish new
  subscriptions.
- KILL routing across links: local operator KILL forwards over
  every link; receivers fan a synthetic QUIT and either
  disconnect the local conn via the new `Host.DropLocalUser`
  hook or drop the remote-user record. KILL is one-shot per
  node so >2-node meshes do not loop.
- TS-based nick collision resolution per RFC 2813. Burst NICK
  shape carries TS as a positional param (with backward-
  compatible v1.0 sniffing); incoming-lower wins, incoming-
  higher gets KILL'd back to the peer. Channel JOIN burst lines
  carry channel TS and `AdoptOlderTS` lowers the local anchor.

Deferred to v1.2:
- Equal-TS nick collision (RFC says kill both — current code
  keeps the existing record on equal TS, which is conservative
  but rare at nanosecond resolution).
- Channel TS collision *behaviour* — v1.1 propagates the TS but
  does not yet drop op state on a peer's older claim. The next
  cycle wires AdoptOlderTS into the membership reset path.
- Ban list (+b) propagation across links.

**Exit:** every shipped item above is in main with at least one
integration test exercising it through two real Server
instances. ✅

### M10 — Lua sandbox tightening

**Goal:** stop relying on the wallclock + container memory cap as
the sandbox's only guard rails.

Shipped:
- **Per-call instruction budget via the existing wallclock.**
  Audit discovered that gopher-lua's VM dispatch loop already
  checks `L.ctx.Done()` between every Lua bytecode instruction,
  so the wallclock budget already enforces at instruction
  granularity — there is no separate hook API to attach. The
  `Budget.Instructions` field maps to a wallclock proxy at a
  conservative 10M-instructions/second rate via
  `Runtime.effectiveDeadline`, taking the lower of the two as
  the actual ceiling. Five new tests cover the four runaway
  vectors (tight loop, pcall-shielded loop, recursion, doubling
  string concat) and the instruction-proxy mapping.
- **Per-bot registry cap as a partial memory ceiling.**
  `Budget.RegistrySlots` wires through to gopher-lua's
  `RegistryMaxSize`, capping the data stack at a configurable
  number of LValue slots (default 65536 ≈ 1 MiB). When a
  script grows past the cap gopher-lua raises a Lua error
  which the runtime turns into a clean handler exit. Partial
  rather than a true allocator hook (gopher-lua doesn't expose
  one), so a script can still allocate large strings or
  userdata outside the registry — the compose stack's 1 GiB
  process cap is the outer envelope.
- **`string.format` hardening.** The default gopher-lua
  `string.format` is replaced with `safeStringFormat` which
  refuses widths and precisions above 1024, refuses calls with
  more than 16 args, and clamps the rendered output to 8192
  bytes. Five tests cover each rejection path plus the happy
  path. Closes the
  `string.format("%999999999s", "x")` allocation vector.
- **Fuzz target.** `FuzzSandboxNeverPanics` drives random Lua
  source through compile + dispatch and asserts no panic, no
  budget overrun. Verified end-to-end with a 10s real fuzz run
  (369k executions, 215 new corpus entries, zero failures).
  Doubles as a regression test in CI via the seed corpus.

Deferred to v1.2:
- True per-allocation memory hook (waiting on a gopher-lua
  release that exposes one).
- Soak fuzz beyond 60s as part of the M11 nightly job.

### M11 — Operational validation

**Goal:** stop guessing about the operating envelope. Replace
"conservative defaults" with measured numbers.

Shipped:
- **Flood-control benchmark suite.** `internal/server/floodcontrol_bench_test.go`
  has three benchmark families: uncontended floor (~55 ns/op),
  N-senders-on-shared-bucket worst case (caps at ~200 ns at
  N=1000), and per-connection production model (~4 ns/op at
  N≥10 thanks to parallel scaling). Numbers and operator
  guidance in `docs/OPERATIONS.md`.
- **Storage backend benchmarks.** `internal/storage/sqlite/events_bench_test.go`
  and the matching Postgres file. The audit found that the
  default SQLite DSN was using WAL with implicit
  `synchronous=FULL`, which fsyncs every commit at ~8.4 ms.
  Switched the default to `synchronous=NORMAL` (the upstream-
  recommended WAL pairing), bringing serial Append down to
  ~183 µs and parallel Append to ~73 µs — a 46x speedup with
  no API change. Numbers in `docs/OPERATIONS.md`.
- **Federation latency benchmark.** `internal/server/federation_bench_test.go`
  brings up two real Server instances bridged via `net.Pipe`
  and measures the wall-clock between `cAlice.Write` and the
  matching read on `cBob`. Reports per-message latency plus
  p50 / p99 metrics. Reference numbers (~38 µs mean / 36 µs
  p50 / 89 µs p99) in `docs/FEDERATION.md`.
- **Soak test harness.** `tests/soak/` Go binary using the
  existing `ircclient` helper. Per-conn sender + drain
  reader; reports sent / received / drops / rate; exits
  non-zero when the drop rate exceeds the configurable
  threshold (default 1%). Smoke test with `go run ./tests/soak`
  takes < 10s on a dev box; the v1.1 reference soak (10k conns
  / 1k channels / 24h) is documented in `docs/OPERATIONS.md`.

The required helper refactor moved `dialClient`, `expectNumeric`,
`readUntil`, and `linkTwoServers` from `*testing.T` to
`testing.TB` so the federation latency benchmark could share
them with the integration tests. Production code is unchanged.

Deferred to v1.2:
- A 24h reference soak run on a dedicated box and a CI nightly
  job that gates merges on its result. The harness exists; the
  schedule is the missing piece.
- A storage benchmark against a real Postgres on tuned hardware
  (the existing bench Skips cleanly without `IRCAT_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`).

### M12 — Polish & release plumbing

**Goal:** clean up everything that v1.0 left scuffed.

- **TLS termination on the dashboard listener.** The recommended
  v1.0 deployment fronts the dashboard with a reverse proxy. Make
  in-tree TLS work too, so the operator can opt out of the proxy
  layer. Reuse the existing `dashboard.tls.{cert_file,key_file}`
  fields that already round-trip through the config loader.
- **Reload-on-SIGHUP.** v1.0 documents which config sections are
  hot-reloadable but only the MOTD is actually wired. Wire
  `logging.level`, `operators` (statically configured ones), and
  the bot list. Everything else still requires a restart.
- **`/api/v1/config/reload` admin endpoint.** Same surface as
  SIGHUP but addressable from the API.
- **Release plumbing.** GoReleaser config, container image
  signing (cosign), SBOM generation, an `installer.sh` that
  fetches the latest tagged binary and a sample compose file.
- **Migration guide v1.0 → v1.1.** Empty section unless M9 ends
  up needing a TS-field migration on the persistent state — in
  which case the guide explains the cold-restart upgrade path.

**Exit:** `git tag v1.1.0` cuts a signed release whose changelog
covers M9 → M12 in operator-readable language.

## Cross-cutting

- Every commit still follows Conventional Commits — see
  `CLAUDE.md` for the type table.
- Every new feature still ships with at least one test, and
  every cross-API surface still ships with an e2e test.
- `docs/PROTOCOL.md` continues to absorb RFC ambiguities as
  they come up.
- `docs/CONFIG.md` is updated in the same commit as any new
  config field.

## Out of scope for v1.1

These were considered and explicitly cut. They live in a future
v1.2+ plan.

- IRCv3 capabilities beyond `CAP END` (`message-tags`,
  `account-tag`, `chghost`, ...).
- SERVICE pseudo-server.
- Multi-DC federation routing tables.
- Webhook v2 event payload schema (the v1 jsonl payload stays
  compatible for the whole 1.x line).
- Operator account federation (operator records are still
  per-node).
